## readCensusExcel
A project that interacts with Excel using Python.  
Expands code from "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python" by Al Sweigart @asweigart

## Description
Takes disparate 2010 census data and calculates the population sums based on county and state.
This data is stored in a new sheet within the same excel spreadsheet, and two charts are made.
One for the population distribution of Arizona based on county, and one for the population distribution of America based on state.
